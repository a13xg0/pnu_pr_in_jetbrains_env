# Main idea

To demonstrate jetbrains' stack of project mangement software for my calssmates I need to create not only working environment for hub, youtrack, upsource e.t.c, I need to give them abiblity to build this environment on their own laptops. 

In this case I need:
* nexus proxy, to store docker containers and other intermediate packages
* windows installer for docker
* configuration for docker to up environment
* configuration for docker to use my repository
* setup my linux laptop as a wifi AP
